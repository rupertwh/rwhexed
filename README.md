# RW Hex Editor for OS/2

In case you are crazy enough to still run OS/2 and need a hex editor, here is
one :o)

I wrote this sometime between 1994 and 1997, probably under OS/2 Warp 3.
Thought I had lost the code for good, until I  stumbled upon an old backup
just now. Also contained a built .exe which I'll upload under releases.

I don't remember what the state of the code was, or if it's even the most
recent version, but I tested it in a VM running OS/2 Warp 3 and it seems to
work fine.

Even lets you switch between file contents and extended attributes. (Yay HPFS)
